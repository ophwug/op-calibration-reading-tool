# openpilot invalid calibration scanner

A small all-client-side web app that scans a public openpilot route for invalid
`liveCalibration` messages.

[Open the GitHub Pages app](https://ophwug.github.io/op-calibration-reading-tool/)
or view the repo at [ophwug/op-calibration-reading-tool](https://github.com/ophwug/op-calibration-reading-tool).

It fetches comma's public route file list, downloads qlogs first when available,
falls back to rlogs, supports `.zst` and `.bz2`, decompresses in the browser, and
decodes just enough Cap'n Proto to read calibration values. If it finds invalid
calibration, it reports that message plus the valid calibration seen immediately
before it when available. If no invalid calibration is found, it reports the
earliest valid calibration as an all-clear.

## Run locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite.

## Deploy on Cloudflare Pages

Use these settings:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Build output directory: `dist`
- Node version: current LTS or newer

No server-side function is required.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
Pushes to `main` build the app and deploy `dist` to GitHub Pages.

For the `ophwug/op-calibration-reading-tool` project page, the app is built
with the Vite base path `/op-calibration-reading-tool/`, so the live URL is
[https://ophwug.github.io/op-calibration-reading-tool/](https://ophwug.github.io/op-calibration-reading-tool/).

## Getting a usable route

1. Open [comma Connect](https://connect.comma.ai/) and select the drive.
2. Open **More info** and turn on **Public access**.
3. Copy either the browser URL or the route name.
4. Paste it into the input at the top of the page, then choose **Quick look** or **Full scan**.

Accepted inputs look like:

```text
5beb9b58bd12b691|0000010a--a51155e496
5beb9b58bd12b691/0000010a--a51155e496/1
https://connect.comma.ai/5beb9b58bd12b691/0000010a--a51155e496/90/105
```

A single trailing number selects that segment for **Quick look**. A trailing
start/end pair from a clipped Connect URL is ignored. **Full scan** always scans
the entire route.

You can turn Public access off again after reading the route.

Remounting or installing a device? The community-made
[mount installation templates](https://github.com/ophwug/mount-install-templates)
repo has printable mount placement PDFs for comma three, comma 3x, and comma
four. These are not official comma.ai templates.

## Scan modes

- **Quick look**: stop at the first valid calibration and show which device
  tolerance bucket was used, plus the pitch/yaw landing visualization. This is
  best for quickly checking where the mounted device calibration landed.
- **Full scan**: scan uploaded qlogs first, fall back to rlogs only when qlogs
  are unavailable, and check the route for invalid calibration. If invalid
  calibration appears, report the invalid message and the valid calibration
  immediately before it when available. This is best for debugging routes where
  calibration changed or went bad mid-drive.

## Current calibration tolerances

As of the current openpilot `master` code checked on 2026-05-13, calibration is
considered valid after at least 5 valid calibration blocks and when pitch/yaw are
inside:

- tici / comma 3 and tizi / comma 3x: pitch `-5.20°` to `9.74°`, yaw `-3.96°` to `3.96°`
- mici / comma four: pitch `-8.20°` to `12.74°`, yaw `-3.96°` to `3.96°`

The openpilot device settings text rounds the tici / comma 3 and tizi / comma
3x case to within `4°` left/right and within `5°` up or `9°` down.

## Useful commands

```sh
npm test
npm run test:smoke
npm run build
```

`test:smoke` uses the public demo route from `op-replay-clipper`, so it needs
network access.
